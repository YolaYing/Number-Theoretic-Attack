# Number Theoretic Attack to DLP with weak parameters 

This GitHub repository contains the final project for the NTU 6104 Cryptography course. The project explores several number theoretic attacks on DLP with weak parameters, including Baby-Step Giant-Step, Recursive Discrete Logarithm, and Pohlig-Hellman algorithms. The implementations are done in Python with Sage. 

# Implementation

## Implementation of algorithms
1. **Baby-Step Giant-Step Algorithm**: This algorithm provides an efficient method for solving discrete logarithm problems in cyclic groups.
2. **Recursive Discrete Logarithm Algorithm**: A recursive approach to solving discrete logarithms that divides the problem into smaller subproblems.
3. **Pohlig-Hellman Algorithm**: This algorithm is used to solve the discrete logarithm problem in prime-order subgroups of a given group.

## Benchmarking algorithms
The repository includes benchmarking scripts to compare the performance of the implemented algorithms, showcasing the efficiency of each algorithm for different group types and group sizes.
